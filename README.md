# What is this?

This is an example project. It's a flask based web app for managing archives of asmr related content. This was made because of the problem of creators frequently leaving the industry.

As of now, it is in a very alpha stage with very few features. In the future, I plan to update it but not in the near feature. 


# Features

* [X] Query your database
    * [X] Manage your database through the web app
* [X] Add data automatically using a json file
    * [X] Use regex to interpret data
* [X] Allow users to add data from YouTube channel
* [ ] Allow users to add data from other platforms
* [ ] Package this as a desktop application using Qt


# Running

python run.py
